# Monkey Language Interpreter

I've completed my study of the book "[Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)" and this repo is the final result.

This project has been incredibly interesting and exiting for me. Previously, I used Bison to implement a simple interpreter without worrying much about parsing. However, with this project, I've learned the simple yet powerful Pratt parsing algorithm.

If you're interested in understanding the internals of interpreters like Python, Node.js, and others, this book is incredibly useful. Not knowing Go isn't a a problem; You can learn Go also during this project.
